- contains three subfolders 
1) 1D christophe is the original optimizer made a bit robust to different initial conditions 
    TBD: needs to be compared against my quadprog
2) 1D without pitch is just a 1D jump which is also ported to pprz
3) switch_opt tries to instead optimize for the switching time instead of angles
