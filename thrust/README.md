- velocity plots or position plots aren't suffering much if I use accelerometer or not
- the residuals show less R^2 after fitting with accelerometer but doesn't really reflect in the deadreckoning
- with acc is non causal and not preferred. without acc you can still have your optimal control do something
- concluding thrust model here, back to lateral state estimation
- after lateral state estimation, need to switch to altitude estimation
