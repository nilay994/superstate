- [x] suspect problems in the discretization, check math `theta is better than tan theta`
- currently assuming immediate theta convergence, do sys id later
- why does interior point algo ignore initial conditions, not convenient
- [x] simulate dynamics properly? `yellow is better than purple`
- [x] see if nonlinear deadreckoning and forced linear propagation are similar - `same as above`
- [x] is positive definite H signifying convergence `sort of`? 
- unclear about horizons, velocity and time 
- [x] should I already couple theta for higher velocity? `no, just use the if statements, vy > vx` 
- [x] am I approaching the cost function from the correct direction? - `yes, going towards zero zero`
- [x] why am I always saturating? `maybe because we are optimal?`
- [x] the optimizer - stops with fvals of e+04, this is too high for a terminal cost `be careful about terminal`
- find c++ solver for quadprog for ROS atleast
- KKT conditions for quadprog and QR decomp for pprz if Bebop
- [x] emulate inputs on matlab first
- emulate it with 2D now, optimize for 2D also?
- christophe maneuver time optimal?

- what gets different with fb augemented: fbgenerated = fb(fromPD) - ff(from quadprog).
- fbcmd = ff + fbgenerated = ff + fb(fromPD) - ff(from quadprog). essentially you are only giving fb (from PD) 
  maybe the idea in lemniscate (https://doi.org/10.1109/LRA.2017.2776353) doesn't make complete sense.
- revert back to original idea, deploy to AP
